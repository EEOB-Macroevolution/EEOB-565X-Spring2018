##### Overview

Today we will start with a walk through of an analysis in RevBayes. For this we will use Bayes factors to compare two diversification models. 
Then we will estimated a dated phylogeny of all living bears.

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. RevBayes
2. [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.

##### Tutorial

Please go to the [Simple Diversification Models & Estimating Time Trees](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/clocks/simple) on the RevBayes tutorial site.
