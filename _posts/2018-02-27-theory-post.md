##### Overview

This class will start with a lecture on Bayesian inference and probability. Additionally, we will start talking about RevBayes and see a demonstration. We will start a tutorial using a simple example (archery) to give you experience using the software and thinking about hierarchical modeling.

##### Slides

Slides will be available on [Canvas](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/46870/files/4524228?module_item_id=1434712). A [publicly available version of the slides](https://github.com/phyloworks/revbayes-workshop2017/blob/master/slides/Lect1-RevBayes-Workshop.pdf) are also available from a recent workshop.

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. RevBayes
2. a text editor

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.
