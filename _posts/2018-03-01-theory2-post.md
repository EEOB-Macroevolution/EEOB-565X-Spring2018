##### Overview

This will be a continuation of Tuesday's theory lecture where we will discuss MCMC. Then we will start going over divergence-time estimation.

##### Slides

Slides will be available on Canvas (intro [slides](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/46870/files/4525224?module_item_id=1437219), divergence time [slides](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/46870/files/4545436?module_item_id=1437221)). 

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. RevBayes
2. a text editor

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.


##### Reading

Please read over the tutorial PDF:
