##### Overview

In class we will accomplish 2 things:

1. We will work to make sure that everyone is able to install all of the software needed for the second half of the course. 
2. Tracy will go over the expectations for the final research project. Students will have the opportunity to discuss their plans.

##### Software

Please see the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for instructions on installing the tools we will use in class.

##### Research Projects

Students may select any of the topics covered in the second half of the course as the basis of their project, and conduct an analysis on real or simulated data. The final project will consist of three components:

1. A 1-page summary of the project that provides the background and motivation of the study (due on March 29, 2017).
2. A 10-minute presentation (with 2 minutes for questions), these presentations will be given to the entire class on May 1st and 3rd.
3. All data and script files needed to execute the analyses (graduate students).
