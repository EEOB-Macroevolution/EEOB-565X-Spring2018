##### Overview

Today we will go over how to specify the BiSSE model in RevBayes. 

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. RevBayes
2. [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.

##### Tutorial

1. [Background on state-dependent diversification rate estimation](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/sse/bisse-intro) -- Review this material before class.
2. [State-dependent diversification rate estimation in RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/sse/bisse) -- We will work through this tutorial in class.
