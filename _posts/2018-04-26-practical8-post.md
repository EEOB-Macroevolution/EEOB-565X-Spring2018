##### Overview

We will use two tutorials that will show us how to set up a simple DEC analysis in RevBayes

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. RevBayes

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.

##### Tutorial

For this class, we will use RevBayes and the following tutorial:

1. [Introduction to Historical Biogeography in RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/biogeo/biogeo_intro) by [Michael Landis](http://mlandis.github.io/)
2. [Historical Biogeographic Analysis using a Simple DEC Model](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/biogeo/biogeo_simple) by [Michael Landis](http://mlandis.github.io/)

##### Practical Questions

Please submit your answers to the practical questions on Canvas
