##### Overview

This class will begin with a lecture and then we will start the practical if there is time. The lecture will
cover the basics of historical biogeography and the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model.

##### Tutorial

For this class, we will use RevBayes and the following tutorial:

1. [Introduction to Historical Biogeography in RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/revbayes-site/tutorials/biogeo/biogeo_intro) by [Michael Landis](http://mlandis.github.io/)

 
##### Reading

For background please read:
