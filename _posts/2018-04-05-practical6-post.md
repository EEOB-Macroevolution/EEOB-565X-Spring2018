##### Overview

This tutorial will provide an introduction to the basics of implementing several approaches for estimating ancestral character states using R. The second part of the class, will show you how to estimate ancestral states in RevBayes and visulaize those estimates on the tree using the R package `ggtree`.

##### Software

Please be sure to bring your computer, with the following software installed and working:

1. R
2. RStudio (optional, but recommended)
3. RevBayes

See the <a href="{{ "/Software" | relative_url }}">Software page</a> for details about the programs we'll use.
